12,"12 Dimensions, units and calculations    A 1    Dubai Building Code    Part A    General       A."
13,"1    Introduction    The objective of the Dubai Building Code (DBC) is to unify building design across  Dubai, and to create a building code that is easy to use and clearly mandates the  minimum requirements for:    a) the health, safety, welfare and convenience of people in and around buildings;    b) the health, safety, welfare and convenience of people who might be affected by    buildings;    c) building design to reduce the impact on the surrounding environment; and    d) the sustainable development of buildings."
14,"    The content of the DBC is based on the following inputs:    1) existing regulations and technical requirements produced by the various    Authorities and Service Providers;    2)    interviews with Government Authorities, Service Providers, Master Developers,  Consultants and other stakeholders to understand gaps or inconsistencies  between existing regulations;    3) benchmarking to international and regional codes."
15,    The DBC is arranged under themes to integrate all relevant elements of building  design.
16,    The regulations stipulated in the DBC are the minimum requirements for building  design.
17, Nothing in the DBC prevents a building design that achieves higher standards  than the minimum set out in the DBC.

286,2.
287,  Each Part is subdivided into sections by topic.
288,    Minimum requirements for sustainability are embedded  within the relevant Parts of the DBC.
289, Developers and  Consultants are encouraged to apply the rating system  adopted by the relevant Authority to assess their  projects and exceed these minimum requirements.
290,    Fire safety requirements are given in the relevant  Parts of the DBC and cross referenced to UAE FLSC  [Ref.
291, A.
292,1].
293, The aim of this cross-referencing is to help  Consultants navigate and coordinate the requirements  of the two documents.

307, Annex material contains further  explanatory material.
308,    Each Part of the DBC starts with a set of performance  statements.
309," These set out the broad outcomes that  the completed building is expected to achieve, and  are provided to explain the intent of the prescriptive  design requirements within the Part."
310," If the prescriptive  design requirements of the Part are followed, then the  performance statements of the Part are deemed to be  met and will be accepted by the Authority."

319,7 Adoption of DBC    A.
320,8 Alternative solutions    Projects in design or construction that have a final  approved design from the Authority do not need to  conform to the DBC.
321,    Projects in design without a final approved design shall  conform to the DBC.
322, The requirements of the DBC are  based on regulations enforced prior to its publication  and in many instances the DBC is less stringent.
323," For  example, requirements unrelated to health, safety,  welfare and environment have generally been removed  from the regulations."
324," Therefore, it is expected that  there will be benefits to Developers and Owners in  adopting the DBC."
325,    The DBC is intended to be a prescriptive design code.
326,  Performance statements are provided at the start of  each Part to describe the outcomes that the completed  building is expected to achieve.
327,    Alternative solutions shall be applied to a performance-  based design holistically such that a change from  one Part of the DBC does not reduce the building’s  performance in other aspects.
328,    Alternative solutions for changes to existing buildings  shall demonstrate that the existing conditions are  maintained to the current level of compliance or  improved to meet the safety levels of the DBC and  UAE FLSC [Ref.
329, A.
330,1].
331,    The Authority will decide whether or not a  performance-based design is equivalent to the  prescriptive design requirements.
332, The responsibility  is on the Consultant to demonstrate that the  performance-based design is required and that  it is at least equivalent to the prescriptive design  requirements.
333,    The DBC lists preferred international codes and  standards in each Part (see A.
334,4.
335,2).
336," Where permitted  by the Authority, alternative standards can be used  provided that the comparable standard meets the  intent of the DBC."
337,    The performance statements form a set of overarching  regulations that convey the requirements of the  DBC (see A.
338,6.
339,2).
340,    The preferred method of meeting the performance  statements of the DBC is to follow the prescriptive  design requirements in each Part.
341,"    The inclusion of performance statements sets out the  intent of the DBC and future-proofs it, supporting  a possible transition to a more performance-based  regulatory system in the future."
342,    Alternative solutions which meet the performance  statements of the DBC are permitted:    a) for projects that cannot reasonably meet the    prescribed requirements; and    b) for changes to existing buildings where the  requirements of the DBC would result in a  disproportionate cost to the Owner/Developer.
343,    The Authority will decide if an alternative solution is  permitted.
344,    An alternative solution shall meet the intent of  the performance statements and provide at least  an equivalent level of performance to all of the  prescriptive design requirements.

7261,4  A hybrid system (historically called an up-peak booster) combines destination control  at the main boarding floor with conventional elevator controls at other floors.
7262, A  hybrid system should be used where it is necessary to overcome lag in a DCS during  peak lunchtime occupant circulation.
7263,    a) The elevators in the group do not serve an equal number of stops/floors.
7264,    b) The up-peak traffic is demanding.
7265,    c) There are multiple function areas in floors/mixed use buildings.
7266,    d) Tenants and visitors enrol to get into the building/office premises.
7267,    A DCS offers the following advantages over a conventional control system.
7268,    1)    2)    3)    4)    5)    It improves the time to destination by grouping people travelling to the same  floors at learned intervals.
7269,"    It results in organized lobby space, allowing more people to wait in the lobby."
7270,    It is able to perform express travel with fewer intervening stops.
7271,"    It improves system efficiency and handling capacity, allowing a group of  elevators to transport more passengers in a fixed period of time."
7272,"    It allows terminals to be mounted away from the elevator lobby, reducing  congestion in the elevator lobbies."
7273,    A DCS offers the following disadvantages over a conventional control system.
7274,    i)    It has a relatively lower performance during the lunchtime peak.
7275,"    ii) For correct and efficient operation of a DCS, each passenger needs to enter their  destination and not tail-gate."
7276," Groups of people tend to allow one person to enter  the destination floor, which means the DCS computes that there is only one  person when there could be two, three or more persons."
7277,    iii)    It is not user-friendly for people unfamiliar with the system.
7278, A passenger getting  into the wrong elevator has to exit and take another elevator to reach their  destination.

10406,"    In contrast the Canadian building Code uses a 2,475-year return period directly."
10407,"  The reason is because this lower probability is considered to provide a more uniform  margin of collapse, one that is much nearer to the probability of structural failure."
10408,"  Similarly, the UK National Annex to BS EN 1998-1 also uses a 2,475-year return  period."
10409, This is to ensure seismic design is applied to the most critical structures in  what is generally a region of very low seismicity.
10410,"    Since Dubai is principally affected by large distant events in Iran, it is considered  appropriate not to reduce the seismic hazard level using the arbitrary two-thirds  factor used in the USA, but ensure seismic design caters for these larger events."

11933,    An earth system shall remain effective throughout the  life of the plant.

11954,"    Where several installations have individual earthing  arrangements, any common ECC shall be capable of  either:    1) carrying the maximum fault current likely to flow    through them; or    2) being earthed within one installation only and    insulated from the earthing arrangements of any  other installation."
11955,    Foundation metalwork in concrete may be used as  a ready made and effective earth electrode.
11956, The  total electrode area formed by the underground  metalwork of a large structure can be used to provide  an earth resistance lower than that obtainable by  other methods.
11957, It is important that consideration is  given to the possibility of corrosion of the metalwork  reinforcement.
11958," The products of corrosion occupy a  greater volume than the original metal, and cracking  might occur."
11959,    Continuous earth leakage currents shall be mitigated  by the designer of the electrical system.
11960,"    NOTE: Some earth leakage currents might be  incompatible with other buried metalwork, including  other types of earth electrode to which foundation  metalwork might be bonded, such that it might be  necessary to consider the need for cathodic protection."
11961,"    Damage to the concrete in the form of cracking, due to  arcing or the rapid evaporation of moisture, can occur  where the long-term duration earth fault currents  exceed the carrying capability of the electrode."
11962, This  situation is unlikely to arise if the electrode has a  resistance sufficiently low to avoid dangerous voltages  to earth.
11963," Where, in structures made of bolted sections,  the electrical continuity of the structural joints cannot  be relied upon to form permanent and reliable earth  bonds, bonding loops across these joints shall be  installed."

11968,"    Earth electrodes shall not be installed at a distance  from a metal fence less than the buried depth of the  electrode, unless they are used for earthing that fence."
11969,"  This is to avoid the possibility of the fence becoming  live and thus dangerous at points remote from the  substation, or alternatively giving rise to danger within  the resistance area of the electrode by introducing a  good connection with the general mass of the earth."
