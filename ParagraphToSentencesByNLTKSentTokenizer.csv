191,A.6.5    Annexes    Any annex material is included at the end of the Part  to which it relates.
192,Annex material contains further  explanatory material.
193,Each Part of the DBC starts with a set of performance  statements.
194,"These set out the broad outcomes that  the completed building is expected to achieve, and  are provided to explain the intent of the prescriptive  design requirements within the Part."
195,"If the prescriptive  design requirements of the Part are followed, then the  performance statements of the Part are deemed to be  met and will be accepted by the Authority."
196,A.6.3    References    Each Part has a section for essential references and  further reading.
197,The requirements of the DBC and  the essential references form the prescriptive design  requirements of the DBC and will be enforced by the  Authority.
198,Websites and webpages shall be checked  regularly for updates.
199,"NOTE: Where websites and webpages have been cited  throughout the DBC, they are provided for ease of  reference and are correct at the time of publication."

202,Projects in design without a final approved design shall  conform to the DBC.
203,The requirements of the DBC are  based on regulations enforced prior to its publication  and in many instances the DBC is less stringent.
204,"For  example, requirements unrelated to health, safety,  welfare and environment have generally been removed  from the regulations."
205,"Therefore, it is expected that  there will be benefits to Developers and Owners in  adopting the DBC."
206,The DBC is intended to be a prescriptive design code.
207,Performance statements are provided at the start of  each Part to describe the outcomes that the completed  building is expected to achieve.
208,Alternative solutions shall be applied to a performance-  based design holistically such that a change from  one Part of the DBC does not reduce the building’s  performance in other aspects.
209,Alternative solutions for changes to existing buildings  shall demonstrate that the existing conditions are  maintained to the current level of compliance or  improved to meet the safety levels of the DBC and  UAE FLSC [Ref.
210,A.1].
211,The Authority will decide whether or not a  performance-based design is equivalent to the  prescriptive design requirements.
212,The responsibility  is on the Consultant to demonstrate that the  performance-based design is required and that  it is at least equivalent to the prescriptive design  requirements.
213,The DBC lists preferred international codes and  standards in each Part (see A.4.2).
214,"Where permitted  by the Authority, alternative standards can be used  provided that the comparable standard meets the  intent of the DBC."
215,The performance statements form a set of overarching  regulations that convey the requirements of the  DBC (see A.6.2).
216,The preferred method of meeting the performance  statements of the DBC is to follow the prescriptive  design requirements in each Part.
217,"The inclusion of performance statements sets out the  intent of the DBC and future-proofs it, supporting  a possible transition to a more performance-based  regulatory system in the future."
218,Alternative solutions which meet the performance  statements of the DBC are permitted:    a) for projects that cannot reasonably meet the    prescribed requirements; and    b) for changes to existing buildings where the  requirements of the DBC would result in a  disproportionate cost to the Owner/Developer.
219,The Authority will decide if an alternative solution is  permitted.
220,An alternative solution shall meet the intent of  the performance statements and provide at least  an equivalent level of performance to all of the  prescriptive design requirements.

726,It is an elevation difference between the road level (existing  or future) and the level of the plot’s access point.
727,The gate level of a plot shall be a minimum height of +300 mm from the edge of the  road or a slope of between 2-5% from the edge of the road to the plot’s access point.
728,"The gate level, and the levels of the plot’s corners, are calculated based on Dubai  Roads and Transport Authority’s (RTA) standard cross-section of road right of way  (ROW), next to the plot."
729,"Buildings shall be designed according to the planning limitations and provisions  required by the Authorities, as stipulated in development control regulations (DCR)  and/or affection plans."
730,"Limitations on development include, but are not limited to:    a) authorized use of the building;    b) building setbacks;    c) floor to area ratio;    d) access locations;    e) the gate level;    f) building service lines."
731,Buildings located in heritage areas shall respect the identity of these areas and shall  adhere to any conservation requirements imposed by the Authorities.
732,"The building or development should take the following into account:    1) Arabic and Islamic cultural identity;    2)    3)    4)    local architectural character, especially for buildings of cultural significance;    the building’s relationship with the surrounding environment;    the building’s compatibility with the planning limitations and urban planning  themes of surrounding developments."
733,"The massing of the proposed building should take into account the visual privacy of  adjacent structures and buildings in the surrounding properties and neighbourhoods,  as well as the privacy of different uses and occupancies within the same development."
734,B 18    Dubai Building Code    Part B: Architecture     B.4.2.2  Building heights shall follow the DCRs and affection plans.
735,"Building height    Buildings plots located in areas requiring Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA)  approval (as noted in the affection plan, DCR or DCAA map) shall meet the  Authority’s requirements and the height limitation imposed."
736,Building height shall be calculated from the approved road edge level at the main plot  access to the average finished floor level (FFL) of the roof as shown in Figure B.6.
737,The total building height is the vertical distance measured from the approved road  edge level at the main plot access to the highest roof surface or element.
738,Building ground should be elevated from adjacent roads to protect from flooding.
739,Elevated access points shall also meet the requirements in C.5.

741,This does not impose restrictions on single floor heights.
742,"Example: For a building with G+10 floors limit, the maximum allowable height shall be  calculated as 11 (the number of floors) × 6 m (the factor) = 66 m maximum building  height."
743,See Figure B.7.
744,Parts of buildings and installations may exceed the maximum allowable height  provided that this increase does not conflict with DCAA or DCR requirements.
745,"These  parts include:    a) ornamental elements such as minarets, dome and towers that are embellished    in traditional and aesthetic patterns;    b) chimneys and smokestacks, water reservoirs, elevator shafts, stairways, radio  and television aerials, wind towers, pergolas, helipads and roof shading devices;    c) advertisement boards conforming to Authority regulations for advertising    (see E.10.9 for restrictions on advertising within façades)."

3465,A  hybrid system should be used where it is necessary to overcome lag in a DCS during  peak lunchtime occupant circulation.
3466,a) The elevators in the group do not serve an equal number of stops/floors.
3467,b) The up-peak traffic is demanding.
3468,c) There are multiple function areas in floors/mixed use buildings.
3469,d) Tenants and visitors enrol to get into the building/office premises.
3470,A DCS offers the following advantages over a conventional control system.
3471,1)    2)    3)    4)    5)    It improves the time to destination by grouping people travelling to the same  floors at learned intervals.
3472,"It results in organized lobby space, allowing more people to wait in the lobby."
3473,It is able to perform express travel with fewer intervening stops.
3474,"It improves system efficiency and handling capacity, allowing a group of  elevators to transport more passengers in a fixed period of time."
3475,"It allows terminals to be mounted away from the elevator lobby, reducing  congestion in the elevator lobbies."
3476,A DCS offers the following disadvantages over a conventional control system.
3477,i)    It has a relatively lower performance during the lunchtime peak.
3478,"ii) For correct and efficient operation of a DCS, each passenger needs to enter their  destination and not tail-gate."
3479,"Groups of people tend to allow one person to enter  the destination floor, which means the DCS computes that there is only one  person when there could be two, three or more persons."
3480,iii)    It is not user-friendly for people unfamiliar with the system.
3481,A passenger getting  into the wrong elevator has to exit and take another elevator to reach their  destination.

4928,"To account for this variation the component of ground motion,  Malhotra [Ref."
4929,F.22] recommends the ratios in Table F.24.
4930,The proposed values are  consistent with similar published factors (e.g.
4931,Beyer and Bommer [Ref.
4932,F.32]).

4934,F.33].
4935,Malhotra [Ref.
4936,"F.22] recommends that this adjustment is not  made, since the building stock in Dubai is considerably different to the USA and the  uncertainty in the methodology is large."
4937,"Return period    F.10.2.2  ASCE/SEI 7-16 defines the hazard in terms of a 2% probability of exceedance in 50  years, otherwise known as a return period of 2,475 years."
4938,As discussed in Malhotra  [Ref.
4939,"F.22], a factor of two-thirds is applied to approximate the hazard in the USA to  approximate a return period of 475 years, as used in the previous degeneration of  seismic codes."
4940,"This is an arbitrary requirement, which is country specific."
4941,"In contrast the Canadian building Code uses a 2,475-year return period directly."
4942,"The reason is because this lower probability is considered to provide a more uniform  margin of collapse, one that is much nearer to the probability of structural failure."
4943,"Similarly, the UK National Annex to BS EN 1998-1 also uses a 2,475-year return  period."
4944,This is to ensure seismic design is applied to the most critical structures in  what is generally a region of very low seismicity.
4945,"Since Dubai is principally affected by large distant events in Iran, it is considered  appropriate not to reduce the seismic hazard level using the arbitrary two-thirds  factor used in the USA, but ensure seismic design caters for these larger events."
4946,This should not increase the seismic demand compared to current design practice.
4947,F 70    Dubai Building Code    Part F: Structure     F.10.3 West Coast Fault    The West Coast Fault is presented as a structure on the tectonic map of the Arabian  Peninsula in Johnson (1998) [Ref.
4948,F.36].
4949,The interpretation was based on figures  presented by Murris [Ref.
4950,F.34] and Hancock et al.
4951,[Ref.
4952,F.35].
4953,"Both references show  the West Coast Fault as a right lateral strike slip fault running along the coast from  Abu Dhabi through Dubai and Sharjah to Ras Al Khaimah, whereas  Johnson [Ref."
4954,F.36] shows this as a left lateral strike slip fault.
4955,They also both focus  on the Dibba line as the principal fault within the UAE and do not even discuss the  West Coast Fault.
4956,The existence of the West Coast Fault is at best contentious.
4957,Some tectonic and  seismic hazard studies of the region do not include this fault as a local tectonic  feature (e.g.
4958,"Pascucci et al., 2008, Aldama-Bustos et al."
4959,[Ref.
4960,F.25]).
4961,Other seismic  hazard studies include the West Coast Fault as a seismic source (e.g.
4962,Sigbjornsson  and Elnashai [Ref.
4963,F.28]); however details regarding the modelling parameters are  poorly defined.
4964,A study was undertaken by Megahed et al.
4965,[Ref.
4966,F.37] on behalf of the Abu Dhabi  Department of Municipal Affairs to determine the threat posed to the UAE by the  West Coast Fault.
4967,The findings of this study rejected the existence of the West Coast  Fault.
4968,This agrees with the conclusions of the geological mapping of the area by the  British Geological Survey [Ref.

4971,DM concrete calculator is a web-based application and includes all the baseline mixes  in its data base.
4972,"NOTE: To subscribe to DM concrete calculator, contact Research and Building  Systems Section at dscb@dm.gov.ae."
4973,F.11.3    Standard concrete mixes    A ready-mixed concrete company operating in Dubai might have their standard  concrete mixes approved to be used.
4974,"For any standard mix to be approved, it needs  to have a WAI less than that of a corresponding baseline mix (see Table F.25) of the  same grade."
4975,Preliminary comparisons may be carried out by the client using DM concrete  calculator.
4976,Final approval for every mix is issued by Research & Building Systems  Section of the Building Permits Department.
4977,Proposed mixes are compared to the WAI of the baseline mixes of equivalent grade.
4978,Dubai sustainable concrete baseline (DSCB) is an alternative approach to the  minimum requirements for concrete mixes in F.6.2.3.
4979,DSCB represents the allowable upper limit for the environmental weighted average  impact (WAI) of concrete mixes which was based on an industry-wide lifecycle  assessment (LCA) and environmental product declaration conducted for the most  common concrete mixes used in building construction in Dubai.
4980,"The WAI is calculated from the normalized LCA indicators/factors for each concrete  mix including global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication  potential, abiotic depletion potential fossil, blue water consumption, reused water for  washing and water for washing."
4981,Table F.25 lists all the concrete mixes forming DSCB.
4982,"Full details about the concrete  mix proportions, environmental impacts, and WAI can be accessed through a web-  based concrete calculator."
4983,DSCB does not consider the durability aspects for any one of the concrete mixes  listed in Table F.25.
4984,"It is recommended to consult a design engineer for the right  durability specification for every project based on the prevailing conditions of the  structure (service life, exposure conditions, concrete grade, concrete cover and any  other relevant parameter affecting durability) and in line with F.5.6."
4985,"The aim is to encourage the industry to produce more sustainable concrete,  eventually resulting in lowering the impact of concrete construction on the  environment."
4986,It is essential to balance the specification of concrete for sustainability  while ensuring other performance parameters are optimized.
4987,Engineers are urged  not to over-specify concrete strength and/or durability parameters and to permit  flexibility in designing the concrete mixes in a way that encourages the production of  more sustainable concrete.

5896,Foundation metalwork in concrete may be used as  a ready made and effective earth electrode.
5897,The  total electrode area formed by the underground  metalwork of a large structure can be used to provide  an earth resistance lower than that obtainable by  other methods.

8726,APPLICATIONS AUTOMATION    DASHBOARDS    REPORTING    The following sections of the DBC define the requirements for digital services  entablement.
8727,These sections only apply when there is a client brief for a digitally  connected building.
8728,H.11.2 Minimum requirements for digital services enablement    H.11.2.1 Digital building technology model  Digital services and operational technology (OT) in buildings relies on layers of key  capabilities.
8729,"These key capabilities cover smart devices, inter-connectivity across  networks, applications and processes residing in centralized platforms (including data  sets and user facing applications), data analytics and reporting systems."
8730,Building  users benefit from access to a richer range of data sets that can be analysed and  presented in management dashboards and performance reports.
8731,A layered approach shall be adopted when defining an overall smart buildings system  architecture (see Figure H.30).

8736,MQTT/JSON should be used as the IoT protocol.
8737,The IoT protocol used shall be  consistent across a building.
8738,It is not a requirement for the open IoT protocol to replace the extensive control and  communication protocols which are traditionally used within buildings.
8739,The designer  shall determine the most suitable system topology for the building.
8740,The open IoT  protocol connections do not replace other external data connections which might be  required (e.g.
8741,connections between the building fire alarm system and DCD; between  the building cooling systems and distinct cooling providers; and between smart  utility meters and utility providers) and which shall continue to meet the relevant  requirements.
8742,"ISO/IEC 30141 provides a standardized IoT reference architecture using a common  vocabulary, reusable designs and industry best practices."
8743,H.11.2.4 Building control and operation communication protocols  Digital/IoT integration gateways and interfaces should be provided at the lowest level  where a secure IP network interface is provided.
8744,NOTE: This is to minimize middleware and additional commissioning steps that can  lead to reduced robustness through failure of the middleware layers as the building  and edge hardware is adapted or updated over time.
8745,"It might not be possible to incorporate IoT protocols at the device level in all  instances, such as where sensors or actuators work on analogue signals."
8746,Such  devices are traditionally connected to a remote input/output gateway.
8747,"The gateways  should be configured to communicate using an open IoT protocol over an encrypted  transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) connection, or they may be  configured to connect to a smart integration gateway."
8748,"For devices which communicate via legacy protocols such as BACnet or LonWorks,  protocol conversion should be provided at the controller to publish and optionally  consume data using an open IoT protocol over an encrypted TCP/IP connection."
8749,"For systems such as konnex (KNX), a gateway should be provided with protocol  conversion to publish and optionally consume data using an open IoT protocol over  an encrypted TCP/IP connection."
8750,"KNX systems can be connected to a smart gateway  via a legacy protocol converter, but this option is less preferred."
8751,"For devices communicating over serial protocols such as Modbus, a protocol  converter should be provided that publishes and optionally consumes data using an  open IoT protocol over an encrypted TCP/IP connection."
8752,Technical information about  the individual Modbus including address and payload should be recorded during  procurement of all Modbus equipment to facilitate this.
8753,M-Bus installations should be provided with a gateway that exposes a protocol  conversion interface to publish and optionally consume data using an open IoT  protocol over an encrypted TCP/IP connection.
8754,"Where open platform communication (OPC) is offered in building automation,  protocol conversion to XML or JSON text payloads shall be provided."
8755,"A protocol  converter or an IoT gateway should be provided, to publish and optionally consume  data using an open IoT protocol over an encrypted TCP/IP connection."
8756,"Where SCADA is used in building automation, the system should be configured to  incorporate a protocol converter to publish and optionally consume data using an  open IoT protocol over an encrypted TCP/IP connection."
8757,"H 91    Dubai Building Code    Part H: Indoor environment     Wireless sensor networks or IoT networks installed  in buildings, such as Bluetooth, Zigbee or LoRaWAN,  should expose a smart interface at the gateways,  or be connected to a smart gateway, to publish and  optionally consume data using an open IoT protocol  over an encrypted TCP/IP connection."
8758,Some devices may form part of a managed service and  connect directly to a proprietary internet-based system  via the building network or cellular services.
8759,"For these,  the service provider shall provide an authenticated  application programming interface (API) to allow  access to the data or support open IoT protocols."
8760,Any  managed service specifications shall take into account  the requirements of TRA IoT Regulatory  Policy [Ref.

8939,Context    a) Dubai’s Integrated Energy Strategy (DIES) 2030 has an ambitious target  of reducing energy and water demand by 30% by 2030.
8940,Reducing cooling  requirements within buildings is a key focus area for DEWA and the Authority  (www.taqati.ae/dies-2030/).
8941,"b) Dubai is focused on achieving sustainable growth through effective waste  management, green mobility and investment in clean energy and smart  technologies."
8942,"These pillars support an environment that fosters innovation and  discovery, promotes research and development of new technologies and builds  supportive policy and regulatory frameworks."
8943,c) Optimization of energy and water demand for buildings to enable demand side    management (a strategic part of the DIES 2030 programme).
8944,d) Dubai clean energy strategy 2050 targets an increase in renewable electricity    produced to 75% by 2050.
8945,H.11.7.2    Conventional approach to digital services and smart functionality in  buildings    Digital services and smart functionality have conventionally been implemented  through the BMS or using proprietary vendor hardware.
8946,"However, this approach has  posed several challenges:    e) might not be up to date with latest technological advancements – digital service  applications typically rely on latest software and hardware, unlike BMS solutions  which might not be regularly updated;    f) diverged networks and inadequate network provisions, which could prevent data    to be economically communicated between proprietary systems;    g) limitations to data sharing between building tenants and landlords."
8947,H.11.7.3 Digital services enabled approach  Digital services enablement resolves some of the challenges and mitigates some  of the disadvantages of the conventional approach.
8948,"Providing the fundamental  connectivity requirements in terms of infrastructure, systems and technology allows  for future implementation of smart functionalities, use cases and downstream  initiatives."
8949,"These might include, but are not limited to:    a) analytics;    b) alerts;    c) calculations;    d) dashboards; and    e) prediction models."
8950,"The digital services enabled approach provides:    1) building OT installed that can communicate via open IoT protocols;    2) a consistent and standardized device naming and data structuring;    a) limited interoperability between systems, typically due to the absence of    3) a building IP network which can support suitable IP Connectivity to devices; and    communication channels;    b) complexity and limited flexibility;    c) vendor lock-in, typically limited to a single provider with difficulty to change;    d) convoluted naming of equipment and data, possibly requiring significant    processing before any ingestion or analysis;    4) an open systems architecture."
8951,"H 104    Dubai Building Code    Part H: Indoor environment       Digital services and smart buildings can bring many  benefits, including increased energy efficiency,  enhanced marketability, predictive maintenance and  enhanced user experience."
8952,"Efficiently collecting,  analysing and leveraging data insights acts as a catalyst  for optimizing building performance, improving the use  of resources and moving towards buildings that can  respond to the climate emergency."
8953,This is illustrated at  a building level in Figure H.38.
8954,Collecting data across Dubai provides insightful  statistics about how buildings are performing at a  macro level.
8955,This can support decision-making and  provides the opportunity to contribute to a wider  smart city initiative.

8957,"Research has  shown that within office buildings, this can improve  productivity and creativity."
8958,Smart technology systems  such as desk booking systems and heatmaps can allow  employees to find suitable areas to work considering  their personal preferences such as temperature or  noise levels.
8959,"Collectively, such technologies improve the  occupier’s experience of their space."
8960,Functionality such  as visualizations of energy consumption and water  usage can help building occupants to understand their  usage and encourage them to reduce these.
8961,There are also benefits to building operators.
8962,"Visualizations and dashboards, such as that shown  in Figure H.39, can be assembled to show entire  systems within the building collectively, allowing  a level of insight into the operation and usage of  a building."
8963,"Machine learning algorithms can be  employed to optimize building running, reducing  energy consumption and increasing efficiency."
8964,It allows  for proactive maintenance where issues are rectified  earlier.
8965,"H 106    Figure H.39 Web dashboard visualizing whole building information    Dubai Building Code    Part H: Indoor environment     The use of consistent data naming and device naming  schemas through design, construction and operation,  including commissioning and decommissioning,  provides a link between devices and data."
8966,It is  supported by:    i)    using open standards for 3D model  representations of devices and data interchange  such as industry foundation classes (IFC) datasets  conforming to ISO 16739-1;    ii)    transferring parameters from design model to  physical labels and metadata;    iii) keeping the device identity and naming consistent    across project phases.
8967,There are a growing number of technologies which  support IoT.
8968,Examples include software-defined  networking (SDN) and IoT specific firewall systems.
8969,"There is wide adoption of IP connectivity in devices and  sensors, and an increasing number of these supporting  open IoT protocols."

10975,Foundation metalwork in concrete may be used as a ready made and effective earth  electrode.
10976,The total electrode area formed by the underground metalwork of a large  structure can be used to provide an earth resistance lower than that obtainable  by other methods.
10977,It is important that consideration is given to the possibility of  corrosion of the metalwork reinforcement.
10978,"The products of corrosion occupy a  greater volume than the original metal, and cracking might occur."
10979,Continuous earth currents shall be resolved by the designer of the electrical system.
10980,"NOTE: A possible source of such current might be incompatible with other buried  metalwork, including other types of earth electrode to which foundation metalwork  could be bonded, such that it might be necessary to consider the need for cathodic  protection."
10981,"Damage to the concrete in the form of cracking, due to arcing or the rapid  evaporation of moisture, can occur where the long-term duration earth fault currents  exceed the carrying capability of the electrode."
10982,This situation is unlikely to arise  if the electrode has a resistance sufficiently low to avoid dangerous voltages to  earth.
10983,"Where, in structures made of bolted sections, the electrical continuity of the  structural joints cannot be relied upon to form permanent and reliable earth bonds, it  is necessary to install loops bonding across these joints."
10984,Water mains shall not be used for earthing purposes.
10985,Metal pipes (e.g.
10986,"for gas, oil,  compressed air or drainage) carrying other services shall only be bonded to the  protective conductors and not used for the sole means of earthing."
10987,"Earth electrodes shall not be installed close to a metal fence, unless they are used  for earthing that fence."
10988,"This is to avoid the possibility of the fence becoming live and  thus dangerous at points remote from the substation, or alternatively giving rise to  danger within the resistance area of the electrode by introducing a good connection  with the general mass of the earth."
