to ensure risk-consistent hazard parameters for typical usa building stock following procedure proposed by luco ref. f.33. malhotra ref. f.22 recommends that this adjustment not made, since building stock in dubai considerably different to usa and uncertainty in methodology large. return period f.10.2.2 asce/sei 7-16 defines hazard in terms of 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years, otherwise known as return period of 2,475 years. as discussed in malhotra ref. f.22, factor of two-thirds applied to approximate hazard in usa to approximate return period of 475 years, as used in previous degeneration of seismic codes. this arbitrary requirement, which country specific. in contrast canadian building code uses 2,475-year return period directly. reason because this lower probability considered to provide more uniform margin of collapse, one that much nearer to probability of structural failure. similarly, uk national annex to bs en 1998-1 also uses 2,475-year return period. this to ensure seismic design applied to most critical structures in what generally region of very low seismicity. since dubai principally affected by large distant events in iran, it considered appropriate not to reduce seismic hazard level using arbitrary two-thirds factor used in usa, but ensure seismic design caters for these larger events. this should not increase seismic demand compared to current design practice. f 70 dubai building code part f structure f.10.3 west coast fault west coast fault presented as structure on tectonic map of arabian peninsula in johnson (1998) ref. f.36.

seismic regulations in this part. acceleration parameters used taken directly from malhotra ref. f.22. in this annex values compared with other published studies for region (see table f.23). there consistency between several studies, but other studies indicate higher seismicity in dubai. those studies have reviewed by several authors and proposed to be inappropriate for reasons highlighted in table. 29) source zone model allows seismicity from iranian coastline up to uae coast. 30) table f.23 comparison of geometric mean pga (g) calculated from various references (results to two decimal places) f 69 dubai building code part f structure f.10.2 seismic parameters for asce/sei 7-16 component of ground motion f.10.2.1 asce/sei 7-16 defines seismic parameters using maximum rotated component of ground motion rather than geometric mean component of ground motion. to account for this variation component of ground motion, malhotra ref. f.22 recommends ratios in table f.24. proposed values consistent with similar published factors (e.g. beyer and bommer ref. f.32). 31) parameter pga pgv pgd ratio 1.20 1.22 1.25 table f.24 resultant/geometric mean ratios (malhotra, 2020) asce/sei 7-16 also adjusts seismic hazard to ensure risk-consistent hazard parameters for typical usa building stock following procedure proposed by luco ref. f.33. malhotra ref. f.22 recommends that this adjustment not made, since building stock in dubai considerably different to usa and uncertainty in methodology large. return period f.10.2.2 asce/sei 7-16 defines hazard in terms of 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years, otherwise known as return period of 2,475 years. as discussed in malhotra ref. f.22, factor of two-thirds applied to approximate hazard in usa to approximate return period of 475 years, as used in previous degeneration of seismic codes. this arbitrary requirement, which country specific. in contrast canadian building code uses 2,475-year return period directly. reason because this lower probability considered to provide more uniform margin of collapse, one that much nearer to probability of structural failure. similarly, uk national annex to bs en 1998-1 also uses 2,475-year return period. this to ensure seismic design applied to most critical structures in what generally region of very low seismicity. since dubai principally affected by large distant events in iran, it considered appropriate not to reduce seismic hazard level using arbitrary two-thirds factor used in usa, but ensure seismic design caters for these larger events. this should not increase seismic demand compared to current design practice. f 70 dubai building code part f structure f.10.3 west coast fault west coast fault presented as structure on tectonic map of arabian peninsula in johnson (1998) ref. f.36. interpretation based on figures presented by murris ref. f.34 and hancock et al. ref. f.35. both references show west coast fault as right lateral strike slip fault running along coast from abu dhabi through dubai and sharjah to ras al khaimah, whereas johnson ref. f.36 shows this as left lateral strike slip fault. they also both focus on dibba line as principal fault within uae and do not even discuss west coast fault. 32) existence of west coast fault at best contentious. some tectonic and seismic hazard studies of region do not include this fault as local tectonic feature (e.g. pascucci et al., 2008, aldama-bustos et al. ref. f.25). other seismic hazard studies include west coast fault as seismic source (e.g. sigbjornsson and elnashai ref. f.28) however details regarding modelling parameters poorly defined. 33) h.4.2 protection of structure building or structure shall not be weakened by installation of mechanical systems. mechanical equipment

and standards a.4.4 safe by design principle of “safe by design” requires consultant to address health and safety of all occupants, contractors and users of building. this includes contractors, maintenance staff, occupants, visitors and demolition teams throughout building lifecycle. 4) hierarchy of adopted codes and standards defined as follows. 5) d) international codes and standards for design, material and product specification listed under heading of “essential references” in each part, and referenced in relevant sections of each part, also requirements of dbc. e) documents listed under heading of “further reading” in each part provided for information as useful guides to building design. where there conflict between dbc and reference model codes or standards, most restrictive/highest performance requirements shall be met. 6) where there conflict between general requirement and specific requirement of dbc or its referenced codes/standards then specific requirement applies. 7) dbc lists preferred international codes and standards in each part (see a.4.2). where permitted by authority, alternative standards can be used provided that comparable standard meets intent of dbc. performance statements form set of overarching regulations that convey requirements of dbc (see a.6.2). preferred method of meeting performance statements of dbc to follow prescriptive design requirements in each part. inclusion of performance statements sets out intent of dbc and future-proofs it, supporting possible transition to more performance-based regulatory system in future. 8) ref. b.3 dubai health authority, 2012. hospital regulation. dubai dubai health authority. ref. b.4 dubai health authority, 2012. standards for day surgery centers.
